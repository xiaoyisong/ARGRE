However, the presence of Cole 's fresh 4th Division, still formed up in readiness behind Lumley 's squadrons, seems to have persuaded Soult not to use his strong force of horsemen.

Hummel 's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but FIFA worried about moir\u00e9 artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player 's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur 's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes.

Rhodes appeared at The Great American Bash to prevent Orton from further attacking his father. The next night on Raw, Rhodes challenged Orton to a rematch from the previous week, only to lose again. Orton followed this up by kicking Rhodes ' father in the head, similar to how he had in storyline nearly ended the careers of both Shawn Michaels and Rob Van Dam.

Commenting on Cooper 's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, \" He worked very hard and yet he didn 't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you 'd look at him during a scene and you 'd think ... this isn 't going to be any good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he 'd been thinking. \" Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper 's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, \" What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he 's perfect, yet on the set you 'd swear it 's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures. \" His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor.", "gold": "Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, \" The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering \u2014 and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed."}

{"prompt": " Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in matriarchal ( female-led ) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. It is therefore probable that most of their other social behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants. It is unknown how many mammoths lived at one location at a time, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. It is likely that the amounts varied by season and life-cycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas.", "gold": "Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300 \u2013 11,000 years ago have been found in the St. Mary Reservoir in Canada, showing that there were in this case almost equal numbers of adults, sub-adults and juveniles."}

Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due to the position of the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time.", "gold": "Even Shen 's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen 's corrected position of the pole star ( halfway between Tian shu, at \u2212 350 degrees, and the current Polaris ) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas."}

{"prompt": " The eggs are normally laid at intervals of three days and are incubated only by the female. Laying generally begins in late winter but may be later in the year in colder habitats. During the incubation period, the female is brought food at the nest by her mate. A single clutch of white eggs is laid, each egg can measure anything from 56 to 73 mm ( 2.2 to 2.9 in ) long by 44.2 to 53 mm ( 1.74 to 2.09 in ) in width and will usually weigh about 75 to 80 g ( 2.6 to 2.8 oz ).

Their eggs are only slightly larger than those of snowy owls and the nominate subspecies of great horned owl, while similar in size to those of spot-bellied eagle-owls and Blakiston 's fish owls. However, the Eurasian eagle-owl \u2019 s eggs are noticeably larger than those of Indian and pharaoh eagle-owls. Usually clutch size is 1 to 2, rarely 3 to 4 and exceptionally to 6. The average number of eggs laid varies with latitude in Europe. Mean clutch size averages from 2.02-2.14 in Spain and the massifs of France, 1.82 to 1.89 in central Europe and the eastern Alps, while in Sweden and Finland the clutch size averages 1.56 and 1.87, respectively. While variation based on climate is not unusual for different wide ranging palearctic species, the higher clutch size of western Mediterranean eagle-owls is also probably driven by the presence of lagomorphs in the diet, which provide high nutritional value than most other regular prey.", "gold": "The average clutch size, attributed as 2.7, was the lowest of any European owl per one study."}

{"prompt": " Three hypotheses might account for consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ in their ability to use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives.", "gold": "At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization."}

In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians.

Frusciante attributes this recent recognition to his shift in focus, stating that he chose an approach based on rhythmic patterns inspired by the complexity of material Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen produced. On earlier records, however, much of his output was influenced by various underground punk and new wave musicians. In general, his sound is also defined by an affinity for vintage guitars. All the guitars that he owns, records, and tours with were made before 1970. Frusciante will use the specific guitar that he finds appropriate for a certain song. All of the guitars he owned before quitting the band were destroyed when his house burned down in 1996. The first guitar he bought after rejoining the Chili Peppers was a 1962 red Fender Jaguar.

{"prompt": " Nominal impedance first started to be specified in the early days of telecommunications. At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections ( and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect ) and power transfer is maximised. To this end, all cables and equipment started to be specified to a standard nominal impedance. The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 \u03a9, originally used for telephony. It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. Telephones ( old style analogue telephones ) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line ( dialling, handset off-hook etc. ). The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground.", "gold": "A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 \u03a9 so the two of them together are terminating the line in 600 \u03a9."}

{"prompt": " The trials with the Chesma greatly affected the armour protection design of the Borodino-class ships. The Krupp cemented-armour plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints, and they were locked together with mortise-and-tenon joints to better distribute the shock of a shell 's impact. The 237.5 millimetres ( 9.35 in ) waterline belt covered the middle 151.2 metres ( 496 ft 1 in ) of the ship.

{"prompt": " Early on September 7, the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) noted that although Maria was in an area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did not anticipate any strengthening. The system changed little in organization over the next 24 hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible satellite imagery depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear. The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) on September 8 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system 's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight into the system early on September 9, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a non-tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands. Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance.", "gold": "When the system approached the northern Leeward Islands on September 10, satellite imagery and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40 mi ( 65 km ) east-southeast of Antigua."}

This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation. Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.", "gold": "Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on modal ideas of what might exist in different worlds."}

{"prompt": " One of Prawer 's best known works is the Histoire du Royaume Latin de J\u00e9rusalem, which won him the Prix Gustave Schlumberger of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. The two-volume work presents the crusader states as a working immigrant society, and shows the importance of immigration and labor shortages. Another book by Prawer, The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem: European Colonialism in the Middle Ages, which was intended for a larger audience, was more controversial. In it, he portrays the crusaders as a society of Frankish immigrants living in complete political and social segregation from the local Muslim and Syro-Christian population, and terms this phenomenon \" Apartheid \". To Prawer, it is the settlers ' refusal to assimilate and their reconstruction of a European-type society on foreign soil, as well as the persistence of indigenous institutions without any interference, that mark the Crusader settlement as colonialist. His thesis is that the economy, society, and institutions of the Latin states are best understood in the light of their colonial status.", "gold": "The 1980 book Crusader Institutions collected a number of his earlier publications and expanded upon them with revisions and new chapters."}

It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral. Second class funerals cost \u00a3 1 ( about \u00a3 85 in 2016 terms ) and allowed some control over the burial location. The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings ( about \u00a3 42 in 2016 terms ); if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re-use the grave in future. Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves ( other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave ) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. ( The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare. ) Despite this, Brookwood 's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.", "gold": "Brookwood was one of the few cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the need to take a day off work."}

Bowen, the paratroopers were tasked with the objectives of cutting off the retreating North Korean forces that were withdrawing up the west coast of the Korean Peninsula and releasing American and South Korean prisoners of war. The plan envisioned the 1st and 3rd Battalions, US 187 RCT dropping southeast of Sukchon to seize the town, before establishing blocking positions on the two main highways and the railway to Pyongyang.

The American paratroopers would then hold their positions while the US Eighth Army pushed northwards to link up them, a task which was expected to be complete within two days. US intelligence indicated that a trainload of American prisoners of war was moving north by night from Pyongyang, and Bowen hoped to intercept their train and release the men. As the US Eighth Army crossed the 38th Parallel MacArthur had held US 187 RCT at Kimpo Airfield near Seoul as the theatre reserve, with the intent of using them as a blocking force to prevent the anticipated North Korean withdrawal. Yet anxious not to expose the lightly equipped paratroopers by projecting them too far forward of the advance, MacArthur kept them back, and after changing the date twice, they were not dropped until 20 October.

Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64 % of Australian ravens perished in their first year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as they are more likely to come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country 's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked.

{"prompt": " Passenger pigeons were shot with such ease that many did not consider them to be a game bird, as an amateur hunter could easily bring down six with one shotgun blast; a particularly good shot with both barrels of a shotgun at a roost could kill 61 birds. The birds were frequently shot either in flight during migration or immediately after, when they commonly perched in dead, exposed trees. Hunters only had to shoot toward the sky without aiming, and many pigeons would be brought down. The pigeons proved difficult to shoot head-on, so hunters typically waited for the flocks to pass overhead before shooting them.

{"prompt": " Nihilistic initially looked at existing game engines such as the Quake engine and Unreal Engine, but decided those engines, which were primarily designed for first-person shooters, would not be sufficient for its point-and-click driven RPG and decided to create its own engine for development of Redemption. This was the NOD engine, which the developers could customize for the game 's 3D perspective and role-playing mechanics. The team also considered that developing its own engine would allow it to freely reuse code for future projects or to license the engine for profit. NOD was prototyped using the Glide application programming interface ( API ) because the team believed it would be more stable during the engine 's development, intending that once the engine was more complete, it would be moved to a more general API designed to support a wide range of hardware such as Direct3D. However, once a basic engine was in place in Glide, the programmers turned their attention to gameplay and functionality. By June 1999, Redemption was still running in Glide, which at that point lacked some of the basic features the team needed to demonstrate at that year 's Electronic Entertainment Expo. When the team eventually switched to Direct3D, it was forced to abandon some custom code it had built to compensate for Glide 's limitations such as texture and graphic management, which required the re-exporting of hundreds of levels and models for the new software.", "gold": "The late API switch also limited the time available to test the game 's compatibility on a wide range of hardware."}

{"prompt": " A tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below 26.5 \u00b0 C ( 79.7 \u00b0 F ). This will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics, such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center, and become a remnant low-pressure area. These remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity. This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North Pacific. Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear, causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone. In addition, its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies, by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone, can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones. This transition can take 1 \u2013 3 days. Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated, it can still have tropical storm force ( or occasionally hurricane / typhoon force ) winds and drop several inches of rainfall. In the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of North America. These phenomena can also affect Europe, where they are known as European windstorms; Hurricane Iris 's extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995. A cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure, becoming a larger area of low pressure. This can strengthen the resultant system, although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone.", "gold": "Studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones."}

{"prompt": " Pick was pleased with the results and at a DIA dinner in 1926 proclaimed \" that a new style of architectural decoration will arise \" leading to a \" Modern London \u2013 modern not garbled classic or Renaissance. \" Amongst Pick 's next commissions for Holden were the redesign of Piccadilly Circus station ( 1925 \u2013 28 ), where a wide subterranean concourse and ticket hall were built beneath the road junction, and the Underground Group 's new headquarters building at 55 Broadway, St James 's ( 1925 \u2013 1929 ). The new headquarters building was on an awkwardly shaped site, partly over the platforms and tracks of St. James 's Park station. Although Holden 's practice had not designed such a large office building, it did have experience of large hospital design, which Pick saw as complementary to the design of a modern office building. When completed, the twelve-storey, 176-foot ( 54 m ) high cruciform building was the tallest in London and the tower dominated the skyline. The building was well received by architectural critics and won Holden the RIBA 's London Architecture Medal for 1929. Two sculptures commissioned for the building were less well received, generating considerable controversy in the media. The nudity and primitive carving of Day and Night by Jacob Epstein led to calls for them to be removed from the building and the board of the Underground Group considered replacing them with new sculptures by another artist. Although he privately admitted later that the sculptures were not to his taste, Pick publicly supported Holden 's selection of Epstein as sculptor and offered to resign over the matter.", "gold": "The crisis was averted when Epstein was persuaded to reduce the length of the penis of one of the figures and the sculptures remained in place."}

{"prompt": " Jaguar populations are rapidly declining. The animal is considered Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ), meaning it may be threatened with extinction in the near future. The loss of parts of its range, including its virtual elimination from its historic northern areas and the increasing fragmentation of the remaining range, have contributed to this status. The 1960s had particularly significant declines, with more than 15,000 jaguar skins brought out of the Brazilian Amazon yearly; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 1973 brought about a sharp decline in the pelt trade. Detailed work performed under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Society revealed the animal has lost 37 percent of its historic range, with its status unknown in an additional 18 percent.", "gold": "More encouragingly, the probability of long-term survival was considered high in 70 percent of its remaining range, particularly in the Amazon basin and the adjoining Gran Chaco and Pantanal."}

{"prompt": " Unlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert 's do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the Grove Dictionary of American Music Larry Stempel writes, \" By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy. \" The theatre writer Gerald Bordman calls Wodehouse \" the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day \".", "gold": "The composer Richard Rodgers wrote, \" Before Larry Hart, only P.G.

In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from the Sunrise Highway ( NY 27 ) north to an intersection with CR 101 ( Middle Neck Road ) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY 101 and the right-of-way of an abandoned Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, may have become a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed.

{"prompt": " A second wave of progressive rock bands appeared in the early 1980s and have since been categorized as a separate \" neo-progressive rock \" subgenre. These largely keyboard-based bands played extended compositions with complex musical and lyrical structures.

{"prompt": " The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid \u2013 base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge ( i.e., anion ) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged ( i.e., cation ) species denoted by the symbol H +. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex.", "gold": "As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics."}

{"prompt": " The population of grey parrots described from the island of R\u00e9union ( referred to as Psittacula cf. bensoni by Hume ) is thought to have been conspecific with that on Mauritius. Until subfossils of P. bensoni are found on R\u00e9union, it cannot be confirmed whether the grey parrots of the two islands belonged to the same species. In the 1860s, French naturalists Charles Coquerel and Auguste Vinson suggested these could have been parrots of the genus Coracopsis, but fossils of neither that genus nor Psittacula have ever been found on R\u00e9union. Whilst Coracopsis parrots are known to have been introduced to that island in the 1700s, a population did not become established. While no live or dead Mascarene grey parakeets are known with certainty to have been exported, Hume has suggested that a brown parrot specimen \u2014 once housed in Cabinet du Roi but now lost \u2014 may have been a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet, or perhaps a lesser vasa parrot ( Coracopsis nigra ).", "gold": "This specimen was described by Comte de Buffon in 1779."}

{"prompt": " Vervet monkeys have four confirmed predators: leopards, eagles, pythons, and baboons. The sighting of each predator elicits an acoustically distinct alarm call. In experimentation with unreliable signalers, individuals became habituated to incorrect calls from a specific individual. Though the response was lessened for a specific predator, if an unreliable individual gives an alarm call for a different predator, group members respond as if the alarm caller is, in fact, reliable. This suggests vervet monkeys are able to recognize and to respond to not only the individual calling, but also to the semantics of what the individual is communicating. It is believed that vervet monkeys have up to 30 different alarm calls.", "gold": "In the wild vervet monkeys have been seen giving a different call when seeing a human being approaching, leading to researchers believing that vervet monkeys may have a way of distinguishing between different land and flight predators."}
